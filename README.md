# ML_Project_Breast_cancer
Breast Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning For our final project, we focused on building a machine learning model for breast cancer detection. The dataset used includes diverse patient samples, with tumors classified as either malignant or benign. Our objective was to develop a model that accurately predicts tumor classification. We carefully split the data into training and test sets, trained our model, and evaluated its performance. This project provided valuable insights into the medical field and advanced machine learning techniques, making it both educational and impactful.
